All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This changelog follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format  
and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Migrated from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4. Replaced legacy custom variants with native support using the `@theme` directive. This simplifies the component's variant logic.  
  [#152](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/152)

- Updated color token naming to align with Tailwind v4 standards.  
  [#125](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/125)

### Notes

- All variant definitions and sizing logic were simplified thanks to Tailwindâ€™s native support for state-based selectors like `:user-valid` and `:placeholder-shown`.
