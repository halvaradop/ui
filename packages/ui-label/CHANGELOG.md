## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.5.0] - 2025-06-09 (Version @legacy for React 18)

> **Release: React 18 Support**
>
> Version **0.y.z** marks the official release of our component library with full **React 18** compatibility. This version is a **direct promotion of the latest pre-release (`0.y.z-rc.n`)** and has passed all stability and regression tests in real-world environments. It includes all changes, improvements, and fixes introduced during the `rc` phase.
>
> While this release contains substantial updates (such as the complete migration to Tailwind CSS v4 and accessibility enhancements) similar to those in the main (`latest`) version, its purpose is to provide a dedicated support line for projects that still rely on React 18. Active development has moved to the `master` branch, which targets React 19.
>
> **Recommended update for React 18 users!**
>
> We strongly recommend updating to this version if your project still depends on React 18 to benefit from the latest fixes and optimizations. You can install it using the `legacy` tag on npm:
>
> ```bash
> npm install @halvaradop/ui@legacy
> ```
>
> We encourage users to plan their migration to React 19 to take advantage of the latest features and optimizations available in the `master` branch.

## [0.4.0-rc.1] - 2025-06-07

### Changed

- Migrated from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4. Updated internal CSS variable system to use native support from Tailwind v4 and the `@theme` directive. Old variables were removed and new ones were added. This affected the Label componentâ€™s styling and structure.  
  [#152](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/152)

- Renamed color-related CSS variables such as `--color-font-100` and `--color-font-200` to `--color-base` and `--color-inverse` for naming consistency.  
  [#125](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/125)

- Removed dependency on `@halvaradop/ui-core` and switched to the new `@halvaradop/ui-slot` package for Slot functionality, reducing package size.  
  [#151](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/151)

### Notes

- The migration to Tailwind CSS v4 removes the need for defining variants in `tailwind.config.ts`, allowing simpler native theming.
- Ensure all usages of `Slot` are updated to use `@halvaradop/ui-slot`.
- This is a **release candidate** published under the `rc` tag to validate changes in preparation for the upcoming `1.0.0` major release.  
  See [#170](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/170)
- Versioning and publishing were automated using the `release.bash` script.  
  See [#170](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/170)
- The purpose of this release is to test the release workflow in real environments before finalizing the stable release.  
  See [#170](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/170)

> No breaking changes have been introduced in this release candidate.  
> The final release will follow after successful validation.

This release was initiated based on [#169](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/issues/169), which outlines the reasoning for upgrading to a stable major version.
