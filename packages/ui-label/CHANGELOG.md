# CHANGELOG - @halvaradop/ui-label

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

This changelog follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format  
and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Migrated from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4. Updated internal CSS variable system to use native support from Tailwind v4 and the `@theme` directive. Old variables were removed and new ones were added. This affected the Label componentâ€™s styling and structure.  
  [#152](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/152)

- Renamed color-related CSS variables such as `--color-font-100` and `--color-font-200` to `--color-base` and `--color-inverse` for naming consistency.  
  [#125](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/125)

- Removed dependency on `@halvaradop/ui-core` and switched to the new `@halvaradop/ui-slot` package for Slot functionality, reducing package size.  
  [#151](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/151)

### Notes

- The migration to Tailwind CSS v4 removes the need for defining variants in `tailwind.config.ts`, allowing simpler native theming.
- Ensure all usages of `Slot` are updated to use `@halvaradop/ui-slot`.
