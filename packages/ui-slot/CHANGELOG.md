# CHANGELOG - @halvaradop/ui-slot

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This changelog follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format  
and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-09 (Version @legacy for React 18)

> **Release: React 18 Support**
>
> Version **0.y.z** marks the official release of our component library with full **React 18** compatibility. This version is a **direct promotion of the latest pre-release (`0.y.z-rc.n`)** and has passed all stability and regression tests in real-world environments. It includes all changes, improvements, and fixes introduced during the `rc` phase.
>
> While this release contains substantial updates (such as the complete migration to Tailwind CSS v4 and accessibility enhancements) similar to those in the main (`latest`) version, its purpose is to provide a dedicated support line for projects that still rely on React 18. Active development has moved to the `master` branch, which targets React 19.
>
> **Recommended update for React 18 users!**
>
> We strongly recommend updating to this version if your project still depends on React 18 to benefit from the latest fixes and optimizations. You can install it using the `legacy` tag on npm:
>
> ```bash
> npm install @halvaradop/ui@legacy
> ```
>
> We encourage users to plan their migration to React 19 to take advantage of the latest features and optimizations available in the `master` branch.

## [0.1.0-rc.1] - 2025-06-07

- Versioning and publishing were automated using the `release.bash` script.  
  See [#170](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/170)

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-07

### Added

- Initial release of the `Slot` component, a reusable utility for enabling component composition and flexibility across packages.  
  [#151](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/pull/151)

- This component was previously bundled inside `@halvaradop/ui-core` and has now been separated into its own package to reduce the bundle size for packages that donâ€™t use it.

### Notes

- This decoupling allows better control over dependencies and reduces overhead in components that don't rely on slot behavior.
- All components using `Slot` have been updated to import it from `@halvaradop/ui-slot` instead of `@halvaradop/ui-core`.
- See related discussion in [issue #148](https://github.com/halvaradop/ui/issues/148).
